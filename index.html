            <div class="about-me__body">
                <p>I am currently a Master's student at the University of Toronto, pursuing a Master of Science in Applied Computing degree with AI concentration. Through the application of fundamental probability and statistics, machine learning possesses an unparalleled capability that has never ceased to amaze me. This is what continues to motivate me to work in this exciting field.</p>
                <p>Before this, I had the privilege of spending two exciting years at Google India. I worked as a Software Engineer with the Google Cloud team, contributing to the collective efforts of devising solutions to optimize resource usage across the fleet.My interests in AI also prompted me to become a founding member of a CV-based startup called S20.AI. I got the opportunity to work on multiple projects and learnt how to use my knowledge from basic image processing to Deep learning and MLOPs into creating accessible user friendly tools. In the summer of 2020, I also had the chance to be a Research Intern at Microsoft India (R&D) under the guidance of Dr. Ranganath Kondapally, where I worked on a novel problem of generating abstractive text summaries using short definitions.</p>
                <p>My goal is to deepen my expertise in computer vision and Natural Language Processing, exploring the cutting-edge possibilities that lie at the intersection of these two. With ever increasing use of AI, I also wish to work towards making the AI tools safe and protect privacy of individuals.</p>
                <p>I completed my undergraduate studies at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bhubaneswar in 2021 and find myself honoured to be awarded with Prof. P. Rama Rao Award and Tejaswi Memorial Award at graduation for academic excellence.</p>
                <p>Beyond the code and algorithms, I love to dance and enjoy playing outdoor sports like basketball and going on hikes. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss any of the above. I'm open to all kinds of potential collaborations and conversations!!</p>
